*** Basic pass to insert and inline the "nk_fiber_yield" function call every 25 lines of code. *** 

Technical issues:
- [SOLVED]  Injecting function that doesn't exist in current module (i.e. yield)
  Ideas --- link modules correctly (llvm-link, etc.) after bitcode is generated, etc. (CORRECT SOLUTION)
        --- getOrCreateFunction will create a shell, stil could have an empty body (scrapped --- for dummy code)
        --- add necessary files in addition to the -CIY flag upon compilation (scrapped --- Simone's solution?)
        --- write a function that extracts nk_fiber_yield from some Nautilus source file and keeps it in this module (llvm-link solves this issue)

- [SOLVED] Pass is invoked repeatedly since bitcode is modified each time code injections occur
  Ideas --- End pass invocation after certain number of injections are introduced
        --- Complete one pass invocation ONLY, prevent reinvocation of pass by introducing a marker function,
            pass will terminate upon finding the marker function
	--- Just edit the damn script (THIS SOLUTION CHOSEN)

- [SOLVED] Marker function removed
  Marker function deemed unnecessary (Simone), marker function signature can be utilized by other code (conceptually
  speaking), shell for function can fail if there is no body (this pass will not include a body --- expensive)
  Ideas --- remove marker function entirely, prevent reinvocation of pass by changing the makefile (CORRECT SOLUTION)

- [SOLVED] --- Linked modules allows LLVM to find the function with M.getFunction() ; NOTE: Function::Create() with no body is dangerous

- [SOLVED] --- -fgnu89-inline was possibly inlining nk_fiber_yield for this version of nautilus (not sure why), so injecting without calls to nk_fiber_yield or the function body were not present in runOnModule(), fixed by setting attribute in doInitialization to Attribute::NoInline  ;   LLVM::Module::getFunction() fails to recognize nk_fiber_yield in latest commit to Nautilus (mikedev, 7/24/19), with no memory corruption or leaked pointers.

Conceptual issues (with the pass):
- Injecting yield calls is not smart in all occurrences (e.g. critical sections, presence of locks, etc.), smarter to inject in programmer-written routines, IGNORE at context switching/register saving functions in fiber.c, DO INJECT calls inside tight loops
- [SOLVED] Inlining is necessary post linking, forcing inlining of nk_fiber_yield, nk_fiber_create before inlining all routines and wrapper_nk_fiber_yield ; Inlining via code may not be necessary, pass in flag "analyzer-config ipa=dynamic"
- What should be classified as a tight loop? (Potentially technical issue, likely answered in prior compilers research)

########

inject script: used to install pass, link modules, build nautilus after invoking the pass. CAT-c build (Simone) is necessary in order to build nautilus with the pass.

Conceptual ideas (research question)
CURRENT THINKING:
- Replicate the routine that invokes nk_simple_timing_loop(100) and nk_fiber_yield right after --- using the pass. Variance on both should be close to 0.
- Take the time between yields --- replicate it even for routines that are more complicated. For example --- if there's a routine that does a complex matrix multiply (or something of the like), it will take more cycles/time than nk_simple_timing_loop(100). At this point, the pass needs to figure out how to simulate the number of cycles nk_simple_timing_loop(100) takes, and yields at the beginning and end of a block of instructions perceived to take the same number of cycles to execute. Using LLVM Profilers here is a possibility, llvm-exegesis/mca may be useful here.- Loops may need to be preserved and unrolled after in order to perform the injection properly.
OTHER TRACK:
- Generate a CFG. Look at all possible execution sequences (sequences of basic blocks). Insert a yield call into each basic block. Perform DFS to find all possible execution sequences (should catch cycles).
- Next step --- profiler catches which execution sequences are intensive and which ones are not (this may be based on a threshold of isIntensive() == true, else). For intensive sequences, add yield calls (how many?? --- based on block size?). For non-intensive sequences, don't bother. NOTE: Preventing injection in non-intensive sequences is probably good for reducing overhead
NOTE: Threshold between non-intensive and intensive may give some insight on the introducing yields based on TIME intervals
