***BENCHMARK ROUTINES***

# Purpose: Testing timing accuracy and policies of yield injection pass on fiber routines that involving
           simple data structures, pointer indirection, various loop structures, etc. 

# IMPLEMENTATIONS:
  - Format: name (test topics): routine num 1, routine num 2 

Timing loops (interprocedural):
  - Non-staggered: 1, 2
  - Staggered: 3, 4

Dot product (loop extending, accuracy): 5, 6

Matrix multiply (loop extending --- nested, 'canonical' loops, unroll policy, compile time):
  - Known dimensions: 9, 10
  - Random dimensions: 13, 14

Linked-list traversal (loop extending --- 'non-canonical' loops, unroll policy): 7, 8

BST search (loop extending --- nested, 'non-canonical' loops, unroll policy): 11, 12

Level-order tree traversal (loop extending --- 'non-canonical' loops, unroll policy): 21, 22

Floating point operations (accuracy):
  - Volatile sum: 15, 16
  - Non-volatile sum: 17, 18

Integer operations (accuracy):
  - Volatile sum: 19, 20
